# <Refactoring>

## Description
I was asked to refactor this website and make it more accessible. I did this by giving the html tags with the same styling, the same class. With that I was able to delete several lines from the stylesheet. I added an id tag to the very first article of the html sheet so that it brings you to the proper point on the page.
