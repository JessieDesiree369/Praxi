# <Refactoring>

## Description
I was asked to refactor this website and make it more accessible. I did this by giving the html tags with like styling the same class. with that I was able to delete several lines from the stylesheet. I added an id tag to the very first article of the html sheet so that it brings you to the proper point on the page.

## Screenshot
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
